Optimal substructure: Problem can be divided into smaller subproblems of the same type.
Overlapping subproblem: Divided subproblems tends to repeate themselves.

Top down Approaach: (Recursion + memoization). You will use recursion to break problem to smallest subproblem and use a secondary storage for memoization
Bottom up Approach: (var/tabulation). Start computing the problem's solution for smallest subproblem to same type and and build up till required problem is solved. 
Use of tabulation is done over here, where all the dependent parameters are build up one at a time till we reach the parameters a level same as required problem's 
parameter values.

Digit DP: Usually used when digits acquire certain properties as per the problem statements.(generally)
1. Classy number -> Number with atmost 3 non-zero integer digits(0-9);
